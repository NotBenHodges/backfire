    <h1>Americans move in and out of poverty</h1>
    <p>Millions of Americans move in and out of poverty throughout their lifetimes. <br>
    A study done by the Urban Institute in 2010 demonstrated that over half the <br>
    United States population will live in poverty at some point before 65 years of <br>
    age. More than 10.5 million people who live in poverty were a part of the <br>
    "working poor" in 2010. This means that they were in the labor force for at <br>
    least 27 weeks according to the U.S. Department of Labor, Bereau of Labor <br>
    Statistics. One common myth of poverty in the U.S. is that those who are in <br>
    poverty are fine with the living conditions they have. However, numerous <br>
    studies, including those listed above, point to the contrary. These stereotypes <br>
    arise from the idea that low income means low work ethic, but the truth is <br>
    that many are working to get above the poverty line and not everyone stays <br>
    at the same level forever.</p>
